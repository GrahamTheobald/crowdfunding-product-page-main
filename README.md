### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## My process

I tried to mirror the html structure of the products in the main section with their corresponding elements in the modal.
This resulted in less CSS.

### What I learned

I need to be more considered with my approach to implementing the javascript when projects become more complex.
I should have contemplated the best paramaters for functions so that they could be uniform across my project
rather than differing depending on the function
